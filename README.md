Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting loan default status for a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) using machine learning models. The goal is to accurately identify potential defaulters based on various features of loan applications, helping the NBFC in making informed loan approval decisions.

Problem Statement:
The NBFC wants to build a classification model to predict the loan repayment behavior of applicants. The goal is to identify potential defaulters and reduce the risk associated with loan disbursement.

Features of the Project:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing data distributions and relationships to understand the data better.
Modeling: Training various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict loan default status.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Using GridSearchCV to fine-tune the models for better performance.
Model Evaluation: Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC to compare model performance.
Final Model Selection: Choosing the best performing model (Random Forest in this case) for deployment.
Data Used:
train_data.xlsx: Historical loan disbursement applications and their default status.
test_data.xlsx: Recent loan disbursement applications for model evaluation
